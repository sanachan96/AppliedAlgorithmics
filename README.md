Applied Algorithmics in Python

Course Description:
The course will enable students to design solutions to programming problems using object-oriented techniques. The course integrates the fundamental discrete mathematical aspects of computing with detailed instruction in end-to-end software design.

Reflection:
Through this class, I have become more familiar with the Python programming language and what benefits and difficulties that the language offers as compared to Java (my current dominant programming language). In addition, this course has helped my understanding in object oriented programming grow further, through assignments that allow us to design our own classes with what we might think is necessary in it as well as to code up our own implementations of what a class is said to require. This has given me an experience of working on both sides of the program; coming up with elements that strengthen the function of a class as well as implementing methods in efficient way.
